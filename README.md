# Photo Search application using Flickr API - Designed in MVVM using Combine and UIKit

Application can search Flickr photo API based on a user entered search term. 

It is built using the MVVM architecture using Native Combine framework, and community maintained CombineCocoa and Combine Datasource framework.

### TODOs
- Implement pagination
- Image caching could be improved. Currently, application is not using any third party library for asynchronous image loading
- Units tests
